# FindAChemist
Web app for finding a pharmacy/chemist nearby with a simple easy-to-use interface

This app written in html and javascript and is intended to provide a simple GUI with pharmacy/chemist search functionality in the nearby area. It is intended to be used by those people that would like to locate a nearby pharmacy, but find Google Maps searches difficult to navigate.

NOTE: as Google Places API is implemented, a Google API Key is necessary (need to add API Key in index.html for the app search functionality to work)
